# Handwritten-numeral-recognition
This project using computer vision technology including deep learning and Keras API to train images data and complete handwritten numeral recognition.

(a) Load the MNIST set and split it into a training/validation/testing subsets of 55,000/10,000/5,000 examples respectively.

(b) Convert the digit labels into odd/even labels and discard the original digit labels. You may not use the original digit labels for training.

(c) Construct a network with two convolution layers with pooling, a dropout layer, and two fully connected layers.

(d) Select the appropriate loss function, optimization algorithm (and its parameters), and evaluation metric.

(e) Train the network and record the training and validation loss and accuracy measures.

(f) Plot the training and validation loss as a function of epochs. Plot the accuracy as a function of epochs. In addition report the loss and accuracy values of the final training step.
